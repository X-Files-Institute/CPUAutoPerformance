    Base battery status information automatic CPU switch to Performance or Powersave mode.


O USAGE    
    Customize the CPU strategy through the CPU_PERFORMANCE_STRATEGY variable.

    Racket's permanent background memory usage is about 100MB,
    so this script returns immediately after running it once.
    It is recommended to call it every once in a while through an external shell script (see cpuautoper.sh).
